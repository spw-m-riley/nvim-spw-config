# OneBeer Neovim

A personal Neovim configuration built around the idea that your editor should get out of the way and let you write great code. Fast, opinionated, and thoughtfully assembled — like a well-made beer.

---

## What is this?

This is a full-featured Neovim setup built on Neovim's native `vim.pack` plugin manager with a small repo-local loader for lazy-loading and plugin wiring.

The namespace is `onebeer` and every module lives under `lua/onebeer/`. The entry point is `init.lua`, which boots the config in a deliberate sequence: utilities → settings → diagnostics → LSP → plugins → autocommands → custom commands → optional local overrides. Health surfaces load on demand through `:checkhealth onebeer` and `:OneBeerDoctor`.

Plugin specs use the local `onebeer.PluginSpec` type. When a spec exposes `opts` without a custom `config`, `onebeer.pack` forwards those options to `require(main).setup(opts)`. If a plugin needs a non-obvious module name, set `main = "..."` on that spec instead of teaching the loader plugin-specific aliases.

If you want a friendly in-editor reference, use `:h onebeer`. For the quick floating
cheatsheet, tap `<leader>uh` or run `:OneBeerHelp`.

```

### Key conventions

- Every plugin lives in its own file under `plugins/` and returns a plugin spec table consumed by `onebeer.pack`.
- `onebeer.pack` stays intentionally narrow: eager loading, `event`, `ft`, `cmd`, `keys`, dependencies, build hooks, and synthetic `VeryLazy`.
- In plugin specs, `opts` are the `.setup(...)` payload; `main` or `config` decides how that setup path is reached.
- Startup-critical optional loads prefer `utils.safe_require` (a `pcall` wrapper) so missing modules degrade cleanly, while `onebeer.pack` still uses direct `require(main).setup(opts)` for normal plugin setup.
- Shared helpers (`onebeer.utils.map`, `onebeer.autocmds.helpers`) keep boilerplate out of plugin files.
- Format-on-save and lint-on-save each have global and buffer-local toggles (`vim.g.disable_autoformat`, `vim.b.disable_lint`, etc.) — you can flip them without reloading anything.
- A `lua/onebeer/local.lua` file, if it exists, is loaded last. Put machine-specific overrides there and keep them out of git.

## Language support

LSP enablement is centralized in `lua/onebeer/plugins/lsp/mason.lua`, while each repo-root `lsp/*.lua` file still owns its server-specific config. Mason installs the shared first-class server set, and runtime-owned servers stay opt-in when their executable is already on `PATH`. `.github/lsp.json` mirrors the extension-safe subset for Copilot CLI code intelligence.

| Language | Surface | Ownership notes |
|---|---|---|
| Go | `gopls` + Treesitter + `goimports` | Inlay hints, shadow/unused analysis, and codelenses stay with `gopls` |
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `ts_ls` + Treesitter + Prettier + ESLint | `ts_ls` owns code intelligence; `nvim-lint` keeps the existing JS/TS fast/save split |
| Lua | `lua_ls` + Treesitter + `stylua` | Neovim-aware workspace, strict scanning limits, formatting off in LSP |
| Python | `pyright` + `ruff` + Treesitter + `ruff format` | Pyright owns type analysis, Ruff owns imports/formatting, and diagnostics stay with the LSP pair |
| Rust | `rust_analyzer` + Treesitter + `rustfmt` | `rust_analyzer` handles diagnostics/code actions; Conform keeps `rustfmt` ownership |
| Ruby | `ruby_lsp` + Treesitter + `rubocop` | Ruby stays runtime-owned; shared policy will not prefer a Mason-managed gem over your active Ruby environment |
| Zig | `zls` + Treesitter + `zig fmt` | `zls` owns diagnostics/code actions; Conform owns formatting |
| Gleam | `gleam` + Treesitter + `gleam format` | Explicit partial support: runtime-managed LSP/formatter, no extra `nvim-lint` layer |
| SQL | Treesitter + `sqlfluff` | Explicit partial support in wave 1: parser + formatter only, no SQL LSP |
| GitHub Actions | `gh_actions_ls` | Path-aware YAML support in Neovim; not mirrored in `.github/lsp.json` because that config is extension-only |

Astro, HTML, JSON, Shell, and Terraform keep their existing curated server surface (`astro`, `html`, `jsonls`, `bashls`, `terraformls`) without changing ownership.

### Formatting & linting

Formatting is handled by [conform.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim) — it owns format-on-save for every supported filetype. LSP formatting is intentionally disabled wherever conform has a better tool (e.g. `lua_ls` defers to `stylua`).

The main formatter paths are:

- `stylua` for Lua
- `ruff format` for Python
- `rubocop` for Ruby
- `rustfmt` for Rust
- `zig fmt` for Zig
- `sqlfluff` for SQL
- `shfmt` first, `beautysh` fallback for `sh` / `zsh`
- `prettierd` first, `prettier` fallback for JS / TS / web filetypes

Linting runs through [nvim-lint](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lint) with a split low-latency workflow:

- JS / TS / Astro use `oxlint` on `InsertLeave`, with optional `eslint_d` when it is installed
- JS / TS / Astro use `eslint` on `BufWritePost`
- Markdown / prose use `markdownlint`, `write-good`, and `woke` on save
- Shell / YAML / Terraform / Docker / gitcommit / GitHub Actions use `shellcheck`, `yamllint`, `tflint`, `hadolint`, `gitlint`, and `actionlint`
- Python / Rust / Ruby / Zig diagnostics stay LSP-owned, and Gleam / SQL intentionally skip `nvim-lint` in wave 1

## Plugins worth knowing about

### UI

- **[Catppuccin Mocha](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim)** — the theme. Transparent background, custom highlight overrides, and colours extracted at runtime for the statusline.
- **[snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim)** — dashboard, notifications, indent guides, statuscolumn, and scope visualisation in one package. Smooth scrolling is available on demand instead of owning startup by default.
- The startup dashboard uses a pack-aware summary instead of Snacks' built-in `lazy.stats` widget.
- **Native statusline** — rendered by `lua/onebeer/ui/statusline.lua` with diagnostics, LSP progress, attached client names, and cursor position via core Neovim APIs.
- **Native diagnostics** — current-line virtual lines are the default inline surface, with quick toggles for native virtual text when you want a denser view.
- **[precognition.nvim](https://github.com/tris203/precognition.nvim)** — shows motion targets (`w`, `b`, `e`, `$`, `G`, `gg`, `{`, `}`) as hints so you always know where you're going. > Great for building muscle memory.
- **[mini.clue](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.clue)** — keymap hint popup on leader / `g` / `z` with 50+ custom descriptions.

### Navigation

- **[fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua)** — fuzzy everything: files, buffers, LSP symbols, references, git log, frecency.
- **[flash.nvim](https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim)** — jump anywhere on screen in a keystroke or two.
- **[waystone.nvim](https://github.com/matt-riley/waystone.nvim)** — persistent slot-based marks scoped per git repo. Jump between your hot files and cursor positions.
- **[mini.files](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.files)** — file explorer in a floating window.

### Completion & snippets

- **[blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp)** — completion engine wired up to LSP, LuaSnip, and lazydev (Neovim API completions in lua files).
- **[LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)** — snippets for Go, Lua, and Astro. Includes custom utilities that pull import paths, class names, and function signatures from the current buffer.

### Git

- **[gitsigns.nvim](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)** — hunk signs, inline blame, staging hunks without leaving the buffer.
- **[neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit)** + **[diffview.nvim](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim)** — a Magit-style git interface with a full diff viewer. Commit, rebase, and resolve conflicts without leaving Neovim.
- **[octo.nvim](https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim)** — the GitHub workflow layer. List and edit issues, PRs, discussions, and notifications from Neovim while leaving core Git work to Neogit, Diffview, and Gitsigns.

  Default entry points:

  - **`<leader>oi`** — GitHub issues
  - **`<leader>op`** — GitHub pull requests
  - **`<leader>od`** — GitHub discussions
  - **`<leader>on`** — GitHub notifications

### Testing & debugging

- **[neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest)** — run Go tests, Jest, and Vitest from inside the editor. Nearest test, file, or full suite.
- **[nvim-dap](https://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-dap)** + **dap-ui** — debugger UI with Go and Node.js adapters.

### AI

- **[copilot.lua](https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua)** + `copilot-lsp` — GitHub Copilot panel support plus native inline completion through Neovim's LSP inline-completion API. `onebeer.config` disables Copilot and Sidekick automatically when the current working directory is equal to or nested under `nopilot_dir` / `NOPILOT_DIR`.
- **Sidekick** — Copilot CLI wrapper kept command/key driven so it stays out of the startup path until you ask for it. The prompt picker includes:

  | Prompt | What it does |
  |---|---|
  | `explain` | Explain purpose, logic, and design decisions |
  | `fix` | Fix diagnostics with minimal changes |
  | `refactor` | Improve clarity and simplicity |
  | `optimize` | Performance analysis with tradeoff notes |
  | `tests` | Generate tests — happy path, edge cases, errors |
  | `docs` | Add doc comments (JSDoc / LuaDoc / GoDoc style) |
  | `types` | Add type annotations |
  | `review` | Full file review for bugs, security, and perf |
  | `commit` | Generate a conventional commit message |

### Utilities

- **[trouble.nvim](https://github.com/folke/trouble.nvim)** — browse diagnostics, references, and quickfix lists in a dedicated panel.
- **Bundled `:Undotree` / `<leader>uu`** — visual undo history via Neovim's bundled `nvim.undotree` package with a single-panel toggle wrapper.
- **[persistence.nvim](https://github.com/folke/persistence.nvim)** — automatically saves and restores sessions per working directory.
- **[multicursor.nvim](https://github.com/jake-stewart/multicursor.nvim)** — multiple cursors when you really need them.
- **[slides.nvim](https://github.com/matt-riley/slides.nvim)** — build and present code slides without leaving Neovim. Handy for demos and walkthroughs. _Temporarily excluded from the current `vim.pack` config while its repo metadata is cleaned up._

## Getting started

### Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.12.0
- `git`, `ripgrep` (`rg`), `fzf`, `gh` ([GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/))
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) — the config is set up with MonoLisa Nerd Font but any will work

### Recommended

- [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) — for managing `node` and `go` installs
- `brew` — for system-level tooling

### Installation

Clone this repo into your Neovim config directory:

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/.config/nvim
```

Then open Neovim. `vim.pack` will install and register plugins on first launch, Mason will install LSP servers, and the health check will guide you through any missing external tools.

Two migration-era caveats are still intentional today:

- `slides.nvim` stays out of `onebeer.pack` until its upstream repo metadata stops tripping `vim.pack` installs.
- UI-only startup behavior such as the Snacks dashboard and the Catppuccin colorscheme should be validated in a real TTY session when you change them; `nvim --headless` is useful for health checks but is not a full proxy for attached-UI startup.

### Health check

Run `:checkhealth onebeer` to see the status of every external dependency. It reports exact versions for the core toolchain, keeps the guided installer flow for the existing brew → mise → go → gojson chain when you run it interactively, and calls out language-surface tools such as `ruff`, `rustfmt`, `sqlfluff`, `ruby-lsp`, `rubocop`, `gleam`, `zig`, and `zls` without pretending missing runtime-managed tools are already healthy. If it's your first time setting up, start here.

Server, client, and parser state stay in their own providers: `:checkhealth vim.lsp`, `:checkhealth mason`, and `:checkhealth ts-install`.

Verified extra `:checkhealth` providers in this environment are `mason`, `nvim-treesitter`, `sidekick`, `snacks`, `ts-install`, and `fzf-lua-frecency`. `:checkhealth copilot` is intentionally not listed because it currently returns `No healthcheck found for "copilot" plugin`.

If you plan to use `octo.nvim`, also make sure `gh auth status` succeeds. Features that touch GitHub Projects v2 may additionally require refreshing your token with the `read:project` scope.

### Local overrides

Create `lua/onebeer/local.lua` for anything machine-specific — fonts, transparency settings, extra keymaps, whatever doesn't belong in version control. It's loaded last and not tracked by git.

## Development and linting

When working on the config itself, use this validation matrix:

| Tier | Command | What it validates |
|---|---|---|
| Core | `selene .` | Lua lint across the repo |
| Core | `stylua --check .` | formatting drift |
| Core | `nvim --headless "+lua print(vim.inspect(vim.pack.get(nil, { info = false })))" +qa` | vim.pack plugin state / lockfile view |
| Core | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth onebeer" +qa` | repo-owned dependency and language-tooling readiness |
| Interactive | `nvim` (real TTY) | dashboard, native statusline, and inline-completion / command-driven AI behavior |
| Core | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth vim.lsp" +qa` | Neovim LSP client state |
| Verified add-on | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth mason" +qa` | Mason registry and external runtime availability |
| Verified add-on | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth nvim-treesitter" +qa` | parser runtime/tooling state |
| Verified add-on | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth sidekick" +qa` | Copilot LSP + optional AI CLI surface |
| Verified add-on | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth snacks" +qa` | optional UI/runtime integrations |
| Verified add-on | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth ts-install" +qa` | Treesitter install/query state |
| Verified add-on | `nvim --headless "+checkhealth fzf-lua-frecency" +qa` | frecency extension wiring |

Current validation on this machine still expects explicit warnings from `mason` (optional Composer/PHP/Java/Julia runtimes), `sidekick` (missing optional AI CLIs), and `snacks` (headless/renderer-specific features). If `ts-install` reports local `ecma`, `html_tags`, or `jsx` query issues under `~/.local/share/nvim/ts-install` while `nvim-treesitter` health is otherwise clean, treat that as local parser-cache drift and repair the local `ts-install` cache rather than editing the repo parser list.

For UI-specific startup work, follow the headless matrix with a real TTY launch (`nvim` in a normal terminal) so you can confirm attached-UI behavior such as the dashboard and colorscheme load path.

Use `stylua .` when you want to apply formatting instead of only checking it.

After editing `doc/onebeer.txt`, rebuild local help tags with:

```sh
nvim --headless "+helptags doc" +qa
```

The selene linter uses a custom standard library definition (`lua51+vim+onebeer`) to understand Neovim and config-specific globals. Plugin spec files are excluded from the stricter rules.

---

## Neovide

If you run this config inside [Neovide](https://neovide.dev/), a separate settings profile kicks in automatically with:

- Background transparency set to `0.8`
- Cursor trail animation (`0.1`)
- Window size persistence between sessions

No extra config needed — Neovide is detected at startup.

You've got everything you need. Go build something great. 🍺
